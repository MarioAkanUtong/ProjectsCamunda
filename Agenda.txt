1. Discussion of Your Last 2–3 Major Projects
----------------------------------------------------------------------

What they want: Your role, challenges, and outcomes — showing ownership, problem-solving, and impact.

Scenario:

Sample Answer:

“In my last role, I led a cloud migration project where I automated provisioning using Terraform and 
configuration management with Ansible. I wrote reusable Terraform modules to deploy network, compute, 
and storage resources across dev, staging, and production. One challenge was managing secret handling 
securely,so I integrated HashiCorp Vault with our pipelines. As a result, deployment times dropped 
by 60%, and manual errors nearly disappeared. I also mentored junior engineers on infrastructure as
 code  best practices.”


 Execution Flow (Live Demo)

1. Provision Infrastructure: Show modules creating network, compute, and storage.

terraform init
terraform apply -var env=dev

2. Configure with Ansible

ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbooks/configure-app.yml

3. Inject Secrets Securely: Show secret being pulled into Ansible without hardcoding.

vault login <token>
vault kv get secret/db

4. Highlight Results

Point out reusable modules (./modules/*)

Show Ansible configuration changes applied instantly

Explain how Vault protects sensitive data




2. Approaches to Testing, Monitoring, and Security
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scenario:
“How do you ensure infrastructure changes don’t break production?”


Sample Answer:
“To prevent issues in production, I follow a strict multi-stage deployment pipeline: first, 
terraform plan runs automated tests in dev and staging. I use linters like tfsec to catch
 security issues in IaC code. Monitoring uses Prometheus and Grafana to alert on anomalies, 
 and we rotate secrets via Vault monthly. Security scans of container images happen before 
 deployment to reduce vulnerabilities.”

Answer points:

Use Terraform plan and apply in dev/staging before prod.
Automated tests in CI for config syntax, linting, and integration tests.
Use monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack to catch issues early.
Secrets management via Vault or Kubernetes secrets, rotate regularly.
Conduct security scans (e.g., Aqua Security, tfsec) on IaC code.

3. Criteria for Measuring Success and Evaluating Solutions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scenario:
“What metrics do you track to know your deployment and monitoring are effective?”

Answer points:

Deployment success rate and mean time to recovery (MTTR).
Error rates and latency in app metrics.
Security audit findings and patch compliance rates.
Pipeline throughput and lead time from commit to deploy.
Feedback from end-users and dev teams on reliability.

Sample Answer:
“I track deployment success rates and mean time to recovery as key KPIs. Monitoring focuses 
on error rates, latency, and resource usage. I also review security audit results to ensure 
compliance. Pipeline efficiency is measured by lead time from commit to production deploy. 
User feedback rounds out the picture, helping prioritize reliability improvements.”


4.  Potential Improvements or Alternative Technologies
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scenario:
“If you could redesign your current infrastructure, what would you change or add?”

Answer points:

Introduce GitOps workflows for better version control and auditability.
Implement service mesh (e.g., Istio) for better traffic control and security.
Move secrets management to centralized vault.
Add chaos engineering to proactively test resilience.
Automate cost optimization and resource scaling with AI-based tools.

Sample Answer:
“If redesigning, I’d adopt GitOps using tools like ArgoCD for declarative cluster management. 
Implementing a service mesh like Istio would improve traffic control and security policies. 
Centralizing secrets with Vault and adding chaos engineering tests would boost resilience. 
Finally, AI-driven cost management tools could optimize cloud spend dynamically.



5. Kubernetes Setup from Scratch (Conceptual or Hands-On)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scenario:
“Explain how you would set up a Kubernetes cluster for a new app.”

Answer structure:

Plan cluster architecture: number of nodes, master/control plane, worker nodes.
Choose deployment environment (on-prem, cloud managed like EKS, GKE).
Set up networking (CNI plugins like Calico or Flannel).
Configure storage classes and persistent volumes.
Set up ingress controllers and load balancers.
Implement RBAC and namespace segmentation.
Deploy monitoring and logging stacks (Prometheus, Grafana, Fluentd).
Apply Helm charts for app deployment.

Sample Answer:
“To set up Kubernetes, I’d first decide on the environment—cloud managed or on-prem. Next,
 architect the control plane and worker nodes for high availability. I’d deploy a CNI plugin like 
 Calico for networking, configure storage classes for persistent volumes, and set up ingress 
 controllers for traffic management. I’d implement RBAC for security, segment workloads with 
 namespaces, and install monitoring/logging tools such as Prometheus and Fluentd. Apps would be 
 deployed via Helm charts customized per environment.”
